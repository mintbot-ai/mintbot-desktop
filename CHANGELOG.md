# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Separate AXP host-managed lifecycle from standalone foreground operation using
  the existing `AXP_HOST` environment variable. Standalone install reports a
  runnable command; standalone enable runs it without detaching. The host's
  command-service mapping and activation sequence are unchanged.
- Remove the portable hooks' hardcoded Mintbot systemd service operations.
  Disable and uninstall check the existing supervisor lock and refuse an active
  session instead of stopping services owned by someone else.
- Remove the dedicated standalone prefix on uninstall while preserving durable
  state by default. Require a matching installation record; refuse unsafe,
  symlinked or overlapping cleanup paths and nonempty unowned install prefixes.
  Keep failed browser-driver installation retryable. Explicit purge remains
  opt-in; shared system packages and cache are not removed.
- Document standalone installation, foreground use, supervisor ownership,
  authenticated browser access, cleanup and the hostless trust trade-off.
- Add isolated lifecycle regressions with injected command execution and real
  filesystem/lock checks. No live installer or service manager is used.

The signed 0.1.8 manifest is intentionally unchanged. Unreleased source changes
cannot match that published artifact digest; the release digest gate must pass
again after an authorized signed release. No signing key is needed for these
lifecycle tests.
